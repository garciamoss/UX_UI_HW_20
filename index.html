              <p>Students were placed into several groups charged with redesigning a website from a list of federal government agencies; my group chose the Department of Labor. During the five weeks given to complete the assignment, students learned and applied UI fundamentals and best practices such as usability & accessibility heuristics, UI systems &  navigation, and UI & A/B Testings. Deliverables included documentation of various UI research methods during the assignment’s discovery phase, a style guide ensuring consistency of various branding components, high-fidelity clickable mobile and desktop prototypes (and iterations).</p>

Areas outlined in red annotate the challenges often encountered by visitors to the DOL website. The extent of these problems correlates with the size of the site itself.
